Welcome Page: https://dv-atm-system.onrender.com/

================================================================================
3. APPROACH & DESIGN DECISIONS
================================================================================

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:
- FastAPI backend with thread-safe in-memory storage
- Per-account locking for optimal concurrency
- Containerized deployment on Render cloud platform
- Clean, layered architecture (config, schemas, services, routers, utils)

KEY DESIGN DECISIONS:

1. THREAD SAFETY STRATEGY:
   - Implemented per-account locking using threading.RLock
   - Allows concurrent operations on different accounts
   - Serializes operations on the same account to prevent race conditions
   - Achieved 4.4x concurrency improvement with 88% efficiency

2. ARCHITECTURE ORGANIZATION:
   - Unified account service (account_service.py) instead of separate ATM/storage services
   - Single accounts router handling all CRUD and transaction operations
   - Clean separation of concerns with dedicated folders for schemas, routers, services, utils, config
   - Template-based welcome page with accurate API documentation

3. CLOUD DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY:
   - Chose Render for simplicity and reliability
   - Single-service deployment without Nginx (FastAPI handles everything)
   - Frankfurt region for optimal Middle East/Europe performance
   - Docker containerization for consistency

4. API DESIGN:
   - RESTful endpoints following best practices
   - Comprehensive input validation using Pydantic models
   - Proper HTTP status codes (201 for creation, 204 for deletion)
   - Auto-generated Swagger documentation

================================================================================
4. CHALLENGES FACED & SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

CHALLENGE 1: Thread Safety Implementation
- PROBLEM: Initial implementation had race conditions in withdraw/deposit operations
- SOLUTION: Implemented atomic transactions with per-account locking
- RESULT: Thread-safe operations with optimal concurrency

CHALLENGE 2: Architecture Refactoring
- PROBLEM: Over-engineered initial structure with separate ATM/storage services
- SOLUTION: Unified into single account service with clear separation of concerns
- RESULT: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

CHALLENGE 3: Cloud Deployment Optimization
- PROBLEM: Initially planned Nginx reverse proxy but Render deployment was complex
- SOLUTION: Simplified to single FastAPI service with built-in capabilities
- RESULT: Successful deployment with excellent performance

CHALLENGE 4: Memory Management
- PROBLEM: In-memory storage could lead to memory overflow
- SOLUTION: Implemented configurable MAX_ACCOUNTS limit with automatic cleanup
- RESULT: Controlled memory usage with graceful degradation
